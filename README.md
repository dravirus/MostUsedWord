# MostUsedWord
Code to find most used word on a text or .txt file.

All you need to do is input the text on the code when requested, and it will automatically count all the words on the text for the most used word on it and give the amount of times it was used on it.

Code can also be modified and swapped to work with a .txt file instead so that you can just place the file you want to work with and it would automatically do the job.
